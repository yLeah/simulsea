Scientists have been warning people of the alarming rate at which sea levels are rising for some time now. However, for many people who live far away from the coastline or who have never experienced firsthand the consequences of climate change, it might be hard to visualize just how high the tides are reaching. To create a concrete example of how much higher coastal city levels are likely to be in 2050, SimulSea utilizes Google ARCore to display the increases in U.S. coastal city levels between now and then. ðŸŒŠðŸŒŠðŸŒŠ
